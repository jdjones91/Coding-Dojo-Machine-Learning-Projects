# Coding-Dojo-Machine-Learning-Projects
### *This is my second project while attending Coding Dojo. All work is cumulative, and the final version can be seen in full under "Project 2 Part 4"*

## For this project I took a Liver Cirrhosis dataset from Kaggle (link in project) and built several ML models to see if the information given, could be used to predict the stage(stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, stage 4) of patient Cirrhosis.

What I found was that of the information recorded, there was very little actual correlation to our target ('Stage' of cirrhosis). Despite this, I executed and tuned 3 separate classification models, then applied PCA to the best 2 (which, after tuning, actually had identical accuracy scores on the testing set).
